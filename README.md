# Tech Used 
For this project, I used HTML,CSS,JS and the "themealdb" API. 

# How It Works
To use the application, basically search for a meal and the results will display on the bottom. Hovering over the pictures will display the name of the meal. Clicking the meal will display the instructions and ingredients for that meal at the bottom of the page. Also, if you are not sure what to search for, you can click on the random button to randomly display a meal.
